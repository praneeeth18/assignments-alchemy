Day 6 :

a. User stories 

--> Who is using the user stories :

a. PO
b. Engineering team : Devs/QA/UI
c. For the actions/tasks to be developed

PRD/BRD + Solution Design/HLD/LLD + Each module --> User stories + Agile - Scrum methodology

==> What is the primary area of focus for writing good user stories? 

a. Focus on the business utility : Look for similar type of apps that has implemented them ==> Creating the user stories + Solution Design [HLD/LLD] + Timeframe

LBS Implementation : Location based services 

[Swiggy/Zomato/Uber/Ola/etc etc] - Map : Latitude + Longitude [LBS]

b. The features should be testable 

Each user story --> Implementation --> Microservices Architecture --> Deploying the services/features [Docker/Kubernetes] --> deployment env --> production phase


- Test Plan
- Test Case
- Test Tools
- Test Data

Is the entire test responsbility that of QA? 

==> QA + <Devs>

https://www.browserstack.com/guide/verification-and-validation-in-testing

==> VnV : Verification n Validation

Validation : code base on a day-day basis : Dev --> Test [check if the flow is proper or not] : Positive testing 
Verification : QA : Overall scope./requirement is met : Workflow + Functional Requirement + Non-functional Requirement

How the UI/UX of the screen would be? 
How negative testing 

Text Box 1 : dirty data [js/bad code]
Text Box 2 : long data --> crossing the maxima size of the data [field size : 20 ---------------> actual 100]

Submit_Btn

Agile/SDLC : 

a. For each project : QA --> test plan + per feature basis :: test cases

Execution Strategy	

a. Entry Criteria --> Set-up conditions are OK + Test data is OK + Test Architecture is OK + Test Cases availability is OK
	
b. Exit criteria --> Test cases are executed + bugs are identified also the status of the bugs [open/close]	

SDLC

STLC

==> Defect Management : 

What Is Defect Severity And Priority?


Availability : Goes for a toss, that's the most critical activity + highest priority bug which needs to be resolved

Entire app is down OR if any of the other individual microservices are down

Bug : Severity + Priority

TEST DATA : 

--> Your feature might fail with an different data

User stories --> everyone should be part of the user story + PRD journey

3-4 hours of catchup with "Coach"
Internal DXC folks : "Mentors"

On an every day : 8 hours of work

Github check-in : every 4 hours

Peer-review

Peer-review
Lead-review
Customer-review

Week 1: 

Common modules : 

Enterprise Apps
STLC + SDLC
User stories
Agile Project Management - Scrum

Track specific: 

QA : Test PLan + Test Strategy + Test cases + Test data

Java : Java concepts + SpringBoot + Microservices Architecture + DB connections

UI/UX : AngularJS/ReactJS + HTML5

Design Pattern in MSA :

a. SRP : Single Responsbility Pattern
b. CCP : Common Closure Pattern
c. Decomposition by business capability
d. Decomposition by Subdomain
e. API Gateway

==> Heavy weight process vs Light-weight process

Heavy weight process : Waterfall Model

Difference between waterfall model vs agile

What is a problem with the waterfall model? 

Changes in the business requirement || Product --> F1...F5 --> F1 + F2 [will remain] + [F3...F5] --> Dynamic

Requirement : Will be dynamic in nature :: Requirement --> User stories + HLD/LDD + Timeframe : Modify the scope

What will be the release timeline? 

Agile :

a. Sprint : Release schedule : 2 weeks [10-12 working days] || 4 weeks [Modules that are assigned to you --> delivery

Project --> Overall 6 weeks --> 3 sprints

First Sprint : 01/03

b. Scrum meeting : Note of these activities : Online yello stickies OR Notepad

- What was achieved yesterday
- What will you do today?
- Any blockers

Are the blockers/dependencies solutions discussed in the Scrum meeting ? NO

Scrum meeting == Daily Standup meeting ? 

Project Team : Dev + UI + QA + Customer + PM

c. What are these activities ? :: Tasks/Activities

d. Backlog 

Need vs Requirement

S1 : 

Need - I should have a phone
Req - I should have a iPhone

S2 :

Need - I should have food
Req - I should have a food in a 5-star hotel

S3 : 

Need - Login feature with username and passwd + submit btn
Req - OTP based validation

What are the types of Backlog :

- Product backlog - Overall list of features that you want to implement BUT is not prioritized
- Sprint backlog - User stories that need to be completed in a specific time period
- Release backlog - Features that are to be implememented in a release

==> Retrospective/Retrospective Meeting 


What is release cycle? 
What is sprint cycle ? 

Is release cycle == sprint cycle? 

When should the retrospective happen?

Create a free JIRA account using the link : Use an alternate Gmail address - This is only for practice

You would need to create another free JIRA account for the project as well

Any questions, any one?
